# rna-design-sat-reduction
This repository contains my project work for reducing a RNA design problem to SAT and then using a SAT solver (pysat) to get the solution.

The file `enumeration.py` contains the code for solving the RNA design problem using naive enumeration method. \
The file `sat.py` contains the code for reducing the RNA design problem to SAT and then solving it.
